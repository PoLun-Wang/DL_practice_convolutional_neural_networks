# Deep Learning practice - CNNs
 - We want to use an easy way to introduce the popular technologies of computer vision to people who are interested in this field.
 - These programs are basically modified from the exams in "Convolutional Neural Networks" on Coursera. If you want a comprehensive explanation or any tutorial videos, I recommended you enroll in the course on Coursera.
 - If you need more information you could go to my website or leave message to me.
